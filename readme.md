Smart Waste Management Solution Dashboard
Overview

This dashboard is designed to assist BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) operators in efficiently managing Mumbai‚Äôs waste ecosystem using real-time data, AI-powered predictions, and interactive visuals. It transforms daily waste operations from reactive and manual to data-driven and proactive management.
The Operator‚Äôs Journey on the Dashboard
Welcome to the Real-Time Operational Control Room

Upon login, the operator sees a clean, intuitive interface summarizing the current waste management status across wards and bins.
At a Glance: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    Total Garbage Bins Monitored
    Instant count showing how many bins are under observation. Implemented using a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) to store bin data, queried with ORMs like SQLAlchemy, and displayed as widgets in Streamlit.

    Bins Ready for Collection
    Highlighted dynamically based on fill-level sensor data and machine learning fill-level prediction models (using scikit-learn or TensorFlow). Filtered data is showcased using Streamlit‚Äôs alert or badge components.

    Collection Routes Active
    Visual overview of routes currently in operation with real-time traffic conditions. Managed as GeoJSON data stored in PostGIS and rendered with Folium inside the Streamlit app.

    Waste Diversion Rate
    Percentage of waste successfully recycled or composted. Calculated from backend data and visualized with Plotly or Altair charts in Streamlit to show progress towards circular economy goals.

    Incident Alerts
    Overflowing bins, contamination issues, or illegal dumping reports flagged for immediate attention. Real-time alerts handled via open-source IoT platforms like ThingsBoard or MQTT and surfaced in the dashboard with notification widgets.

Map Visualization ‚Äî Mumbai‚Äôs Waste Landscape

    Interactive map centered on Mumbai displaying:

        Garbage bin locations color-coded by fill level using Folium.

        Dumping grounds and dry waste centers distinctly marked.

        Collection routes color-coded by traffic/congestion status pulling data either from open traffic APIs or simulated data.

        Clicking on any bin shows detailed info such as last collection time, predicted fill levels, and sensor readings.

Proactive Collection Scheduling

    Behind the scenes, an AI agent running customized Python scripts (leveraging OR-Tools or Google Optimization Tools) analyzes bin fill trends and predicts overflow risk, especially around festival days.

    The operator sees a prioritized, dynamically updated list of bins scheduled for collection.

    Adjustments can be made manually and pushed to field teams via messaging queues such as RabbitMQ or Redis Pub/Sub.

Waste Classification & Community Feedback

    Operators verify waste segregation quality at dry waste centers through an image classification feature powered by TensorFlow/PyTorch models served via FastAPI or Flask backends.

    Citizen reports submitted via app/hotline with photos or descriptions are integrated, enabling quick assessment and resolution.

Performance & Compliance Reports

    Historical data is stored in time-series databases like InfluxDB and visualized with embedded Plotly/Grafana charts.

    Operators monitor collection efficiency, recycling rates, landfill diversion, and compliance with solid waste management regulations.

Task and Issue Management

    The dashboard contains a task ticketing subsystem built with open-source tools like Zammad or custom Django/Flask-based issue trackers.

    Mechanical issues, complaints, or maintenance needs linked to specific bins or vehicles are logged here.

    Assigned tasks and response progress are displayed, helping supervisors coordinate efforts.

Narrative Summary

This solution enables Mumbai‚Äôs BMC operators to gain real-time visibility, predictive insights, and actionable recommendations, making waste management smarter, faster, and more sustainable. The integration of AI and interactive visualizations profoundly enhances operational decision-making and supports circular economy goals.

## **Project Overview**

This project is an **AI-driven smart waste collection and routing system**. It integrates:

- **Ward Operators Management** via SQLite database
- **Ward Dashboards** showing stats, issue tracking, and maps
- **AI Agents** predicting issue trends and recommending actions
- **Interactive Map** visualizations of wards and operator locations

The goal is to **optimize waste collection routes** and assist ward operators using AI insights.
